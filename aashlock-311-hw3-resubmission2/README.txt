I did extremely pooorly on the original assignment, so the instructor gave everyone a chance to resubmit a new implementation.
We were given skeleton code and had to implement BFS.
The PA1Driver file is in charge of grading the assignment based on timing and correctness.
There are two ways to run this program:
  1. "javac PA1Driver.java GameBoard.java" and then "java PA1Driver"
    This conducts all the test cases with times for each of them
  2. "javac HW.java" and then "java HW tests/in/input#.txt"
    This tests individual cases and prints out the length of the plan and the actual path sequence
